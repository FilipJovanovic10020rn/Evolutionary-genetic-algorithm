## Instruction

Aplication written in C, used for simulating neural network and its evolution using different mutation methods and algorithms. After each generation calculate their quality and proceed to the next generation.
Genes are defined as an array of chromozomess, and the chromozomes as float numbers. When a mutation happeneds it mutates some random chromozom which will change the quality of a gene.

The point of the project was to see if and how would the algorithms used do to the population.

## Menu

When starting the app, you will have 10 options
```
  1 - Start the algorithm
  2 - Change the population number
  3 - Change the generation number
  4 - Change the number of children
  5 - Change the mutation population size
  6 - Change the number of consecutive repetitions
  7 - Change the chance for mutation
  8 - List all the parameters
  9 - Help
  10 - Print the mean values of generations
  0 - Exit
```
